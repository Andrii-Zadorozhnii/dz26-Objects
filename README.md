Minimum.

1. Create an object that describes a car (manufacturer, model, year of manufacture, average speed, fuel tank capacity, average fuel consumption per 100 km, drivers) and the following methods to work with this object:
  a. A method that displays information about the car.
  b. Add a driver's name to the list
  c. Checking the driver's name to see if it is in the list
  d. Calculate the time and amount of fuel needed to cover the transferred distance at the average speed. Keep in mind that every 4 hours of driving, the        driver needs to take a break for 1 hour. 
  
Normal.

1. Create an object that describes time (hours, minutes, seconds) and the following functions to work with this object:
To display the time on the screen:
  a. Changes the time by the specified number of seconds.
  b. Changes the time by a specified number of minutes.
  c. Changes the time by the transferred number of hours.
  d. Please note that in the last 3 functions, if you change one part of the time, the other part may change. For example: if you add 30 seconds to the          time "20:59:45", you should get "21:00:15", not "20:59:75". You also need to provide for the possibility that the user can transfer 150 seconds or          75 minutes.
